                <p>Amsterdam may be the first European city to understand the importance of nightlife and the impact on attractiveness and economy. The city has a very relaxed behaviour regarding night-related business such as sex or drugs.</p>
                <p>In 2003 was elected the first Night Mayor whose goal is to keep a dialogue open between business owners, politicians and residents, and to build trust between all stakeholders.</p>
                <p>The most famous Night Mayor of Amsterdam is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.europavox.com/news/sun-goes-amsterdams-former-night-mayor-winning-hearts-minds/">Mirik Milan</a> who served six years before being replaced in 2018. He’s known for his involvement in the extension of the clubs opening hours. Thanks to him, many venues got licences to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/24-hour-party-sequel-the-changing-face-of-amsterdam-clubbing">stay open 24 hours</a>. It’s obvious through his policy that he understood the value of clubbing culture, and the need for a competitive European creative city.</p>
                <p>However, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.streetpress.com/sujet/1413472778-amsterdam-dance-event">some people are very critical</a> of this culture-first policy, saying that it’s only motivated by a gentrification agenda, and by the financial benefits of having a privileged “creative class” population.</p>
                <p>By attracting people in post-industrial neighbourhoods by promoting the clubs, and then increasing the prices and urbanizing, the city gets rid of the poorest populations. It’s not obvious that this policy is voluntary, but cultural attractiveness feeds gentrification which pushes peoples away from the city.</p>
