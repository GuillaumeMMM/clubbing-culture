                <p>In 2009, the association Technopol made a petition sending an alarm signal about the state of clubbing in Paris. They declared nightlife dead, and raised attentions in media like The Guardian and Le Monde who called Paris the “European capital of sleep”.</p>
                <p>Earlier that year, a French report on European nightlife showed that Paris was the worst pace to party in Europe (compared with Amsterdam, Barcelona, London and Berlin).</p>
                <p>According to club owners, the reason for this lack of activity is that the gentrification of the areas where Parisian clubs were settled engendered ridiculously strong nightlife legislation. To which the 2008 law that banned smoking inside didn’t help with street noises.</p>
                <p>Indeed, the rules about nightlife and especially regarding noises were very strict. Renaud Barillet, director of the club La Bellevilloise said at the time that he was fearing an administrative closing at any time.</p>
                <p>Thanks to Technopol and the petition, the city of Paris took action and created in 2010 the “Etats Généréux de la Nuit” to discuss the nightlife issues. In the end of 2014 was then created the Parisian Council of the Night which has a mediation role between all the parties.</p>
                <p>The balance of power slightly changed, and smaller clubs could survive. Clubs opened in the zones around the Seine and in less gentrified neighbourhoods, places where the resident associations were the weakest.</p>
                <p>But the gentrification is never over. And with gentrification increases the rent for the small clubs. These clubs need to make money at the expense of more experimental music. That’s why some clubs chose to go even further away, and sometimes to the Banlieue of Paris, to have more freedom in what they do.</p>
                <p>Thanks to new regulations brought by the new mediations in place, the Parisian nightlife seems to have widely improved since 2009 in terms of quality and diversity. However, the Etats Généréux de la Nuit are facing criticism since they may not be addressing the right issues. Indeed, the gentrification seems inevitable, and the clubs themselves feed this process by making neighbourhoods more attractive, thus Paris delegates the mediations to the Banlieue.</p>
