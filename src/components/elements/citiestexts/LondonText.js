                <p>London may be, along with Berlin, the most important city in European clubbing culture history. It’s where the first rave parties were held, and where Jungle, Dubstep, or UK Garage were popularized.</p>
                <p>Therefore, it’s hard to believe that in 2015, <a  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/30817">an alarming report from the ALMR</a> reveals that between 2005 and 2015 half of the UK clubs have closed. </p>
                <p>The two reasons for this cultural disaster are the gentrification of the areas made cool by the clubs themselves that motivates the neighbourhoods complains, and the arduous relationship between clubs and authorities. The London clubs are seen as dangerous by most people, and after multiple drug-related death at Fabric, the club had to close, and London police used this to <a  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/27600">promote a stronger regulation</a>.</p>

Since she’s been chosen, she’s been expected to help with mediation between all actors of nightlife and to legitimate the cultural importance of nightlife.</p>
                <p>Even though <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.london.gov.uk/city-hall-blog/7-things-mayors-night-czar-has-done-her-first-year">she has helped a lot</a> the development of nightlife in London, she’s been facing strong criticism. In 2018, Hackney Council voted for a midnight curfew, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/FourTet/status/1019987222865633280">and people thought</a> that she wasn’t fighting hard enough, and that her political power was actually not that important.</p>
