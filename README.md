This project is the final version of the https://clubbingfeels.com website code.

The website was shortlisted in the 2019 [Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3920-clubbing-feels).

> This project is a web-based application that focuses on exploring the spread of music genres in Western Europe clubbing culture.

> The application is mainly exploratory. Based on all the events held in the biggest nightclubs of Berlin, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Paris and London in 2018, I build interactive maps and abstract designs that show the way people listen to different kind of music.

> Trying to bring context to the data visualization designs, I included the genres backgrounds and stories about the cities relationship to clubbing culture as far as nightlife and urbanism are concerned.
